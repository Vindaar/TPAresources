* TPAresources

A simple repo to store some data files (all ASCII), which are deemed
too large to be part of the main [[https://github.com/Vindaar/TimepixAnalysis][TimepixAnalysis]] repository. 

We could git-lfs in theory, but these files aren't necessarily large
in total size, but simply contain a huge number of lines. I'd rather
keep that out of the main repo.

On the other hand regarding git-lfs, for our real data needs the
support on GitHub for LFS files sizes is not large enough, since we'd
have to store:
- 250 GB of raw data
- HDF5 files of O(30 GB) 
which both are out of scope.
