* Data origin

The data stored in this directory is based on the

=TimepixAnalysis/resources/background_splitted.2014+2015.h5=

data file (which itself was converted from the ROOT tree with the same
name). Note: this file is not hosted anywhere publicly at this time,
as it's too big to do so easily. Ping me somewhere with my nick
@Vindaar (Github, Twitter, Matrix, ...) or shoot a mail if you want
access to the file.

Using that as an input the small tool:

=TimepixAnalysis/Tools/extractEventsFromMarlinH5.nim=
(on Github:
https://github.com/Vindaar/TimepixAnalysis/blob/master/Tools/extractEventsFromMarlinH5.nim
)

If changes to the data structure of TPA is done, rerun the tool to
regenerate the data instead of modifying the JSON files manually!

** TODO Make the Marlin background file available

As per title.
